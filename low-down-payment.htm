A HOME: THE AMERICAN DREAM</span><br>


&nbsp;<br>


If you're dreaming of buying a home, congratulations. You're in good<br>


company! Almost two-thirds of the nation's households own their own<br>


home.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


This brochure describes how families can get into their own homes with<br>


little cash up front. It explains mortgage insurance and how it works,<br>


and looks at the two options -- private mortgage insurance and<br>


government mortgage insurance.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


                  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Why Buy
a Home?</span><br>


&nbsp;<br>


Homeownership remains one of the highest goals for many people because<br>


of its many benefits. Along with owning your own home comes a sense of<br>


security and belonging that cannot be found elsewhere. For many,<br>


homeownership represents personal and financial success. There is much<br>


personal satisfaction in living in a home that you own. A home is still<br>


a valued investment which can have many financial advantages and tax<br>


benefits. The amount of interest you pay on a home loan and the real<br>


estate taxes you pay on your home are among the few major federal tax<br>


deductions. Owning a home is the primary way most people build wealth.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


Homeownership is also good for our communities, because families who own<br>


their homes are more involved in their local communities and participate<br>


in local events.<br>


&nbsp;<br>

                  <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
rewards of homeownership:</span><br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - personal satisfaction<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - stability for you and your

                  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Obstacles
to Homeownership</span><br>


&nbsp;<br>


Still, for many Americans, owning a home continues to remain just<br>


slightly out of reach. For more and more families, saving the money for<br>


a down payment is the biggest obstacle to homeownership. Many people<br>


mistakenly believe that you have to come up with a down payment equal to<br>


20% of the price of a home.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


Traditionally, lenders have required that home buyers be able to make a<br>


down payment of at least 20% of a home's purchase price to get a home<br>


loan or mortgage. However, mortgage lenders will grant home loans to<br>


qualifying home buyers with a down payment of as little as 5% of the<br>


purchase price, if the mortgage is insured.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


In fact, home loans with down payments of less than 20% are increasingly<br>


popular. They are called "low down payment mortgages."<br>


&nbsp;<br>


This is good news for the millions of home buyers who are finding it<br>


difficult to save a large down payment, especially for their first<br>


house.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


                  <span style="font-weight: bold;">WHAT
MAKES LOW DOWN PAYMENT LOANS POSSIBLE?</span><br>


&nbsp;<br>


Simply put, mortgage insurance protects the mortgage lender against<br>


financial loss if a homeowner stops making mortgage payments. Lenders<br>


usually require insurance on low down payment loans for protection in<br>


the event that the homeowner fails to make his or her payments. When a<br>


homeowner fails to make the mortgage payments, a default occurs and the<br>


home goes into foreclosure. Both the homeowner and the mortgage insurer<br>


lose in a foreclosure. The homeowner loses the house and all of the<br>


money put into it. The mortgage insurer will then have to pay the<br>


lender's claim on the defaulted loan.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


For this reason, it is crucial that the family buying the home can<br>


really afford it -- not only at the time it is purchased, - but<br>


throughout the time period of the loan.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


Although the cost of the mortgage insurance is paid by the home buyer,<br>


or borrower, the mortgage insurer works directly with the lender.<br>


Mortgage insurance is available to commercial banks, savings &amp;
loans and<br>


mortgage bankers, all of whom offer mortgage loans to home buyers.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


Remember that mortgage insurance is not the same as credit life<br>


insurance, also called mortgage life insurance. This type of policy<br>


repays an outstanding mortgage balance upon the death of the person who<br>


took out the insurance policy.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


                  <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
Secondary Market</span><br>


&nbsp;<br>


The lender's decision to use mortgage insurance is driven by the<br>


requirements of investors in the mortgage market. Because of the losses<br>


that could occur, major investors require mortgage insurance on all<br>


loans made with low down payments.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


The three primary investors in home loans are Federal National Mortgage<br>


Association (Fannie Mae), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation<br>


(Freddie Mac) and Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). By<br>


purchasing and selling residential mortgages, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac<br>


help keep money available for homes across the country.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


Unlike Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae does not actually buy the<br>


mortgages. It adds the guarantee of the full faith and credit of the<br>


U.S. Government to mortgage securities issued by private lenders.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


                  <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Two
Choices:</span> Government Insurance and Private Insurance<br>


&nbsp;<br>


Now that we have explained how mortgage insurance works and why it is<br>


necessary, let's look at the basic kinds of mortgage insurance. Low down<br>


payment mortgages can be insured in two ways -- through the government<br>


or through the private sector. Mortgages backed by the government are<br>


insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the<br>


Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or the Farmers Home Administration<br>


(FmHA).<br>


&nbsp;<br>


The minimum down payment required by FHA is less than 5%. For<br>


single-family homes, the standard limit for an FHA-insured mortgage<br>


ranges from $67,500 to $151,725 (in certain high-cost areas).<br>


&nbsp;<br>


Although anyone can apply for FHA insurance, the other two government<br>


mortgage guarantee programs are much more targeted. The VA program is<br>


limited to qualified, eligible veterans and reservists. This program is<br>


very specialized, so contact your lender for the details. The FmHA<br>


insures loans for the construction and purchase of homes in rural<br>


communities.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


Obtaining&nbsp; conventional financing is the alternative to
obtaining a home<br>


loan backed by the government. Conventional mortgages are all home loans<br>


not guaranteed by the government, including those guaranteed by private<br>


mortgage insurers.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


Although government and private insurance are based on the same concept<br>


of allowing families to get into homes with less cash down, there are<br>


many differences between the two. Often, the lender or loan originator<br>


will play an important role in suggesting and deciding which insurance<br>


is selected.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


Home buyers must make a down payment of at least 5% of a home's value to<br>


be considered for private mortgage insurance. However, under some<br>


special programs, the down payment requirement allows the buyer to use a<br>


gift or grant to cover 2% of the 5% down payment required by private<br>


mortgage insurers. The gift or grant may come from a friend or relative,<br>


or a community group or other organization.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


Private mortgage insurance is available on a wide variety of home loans<br>


and there is no pre-set limit on the loan amount. Although differences<br>


such as these may affect whether the lender prefers to work with<br>


government or conventional mortgages, your lender will discuss which one<br>


would be better for your situation.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


With the wide variety of loans available, home buyers have the freedom<br>


to choose the type of loan that best suits their needs. Early on in the<br>


home buying process, it is a good idea to meet with several lenders to<br>


compare the types of mortgages they offer and shop for the best price<br>


and terms. Best of all, working with a mortgage insurer can be very easy<br>


-- whether your loan is insured by the FHA or a private mortgage<br>


insurance company -- because your lender handles all of the<br>


arrangements.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


By making lending money to home buyers safer, mortgage insurance helps<br>


more families get into homes of their own.<br>

                  <span style="font-weight: bold;">QUALIFYING
FOR A LOW DOWN PAYMENT LOAN</span><br>


&nbsp;<br>


Qualifying for a low down payment loan is much like applying for a<br>


regular loan.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


To be considered for a low down payment loan, you generally need to<br>


have:<br>


&nbsp;<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * sufficient income to support
the monthly mortgage payment<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * enough cash to cover the
down payment<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * sufficient cash to cover
normal closing costs and related<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; expenses
(explained below)<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * a good credit background
that indicates your payment history or<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"willingness to pay"<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * sufficient appraisal value,
which shows the house is at least<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; equal to
the purchase price<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * in some instances, a cash
reserve equivalent to two monthly<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mortgage
payments<br>


&nbsp;<br>


Closing costs, or settlement costs, are paid when the home buyer and the<br>


seller meet to exchange the necessary papers for the house to be legally<br>


transferred. On the average, closing costs run approximately 2% to 3% of<br>


the house price. This percentage may vary, depending on where you live.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


Closing costs include the loan origination fee (if not already paid),<br>


points, prepaid homeowner's insurance, appraisal fee, lawyer's fee,<br>


recording fee, title search and insurance, tax adjustments, agent<br>


commissions, mortgage insurance (if you are putting less than 20% down)<br>


and other expenses. Your lender will give you a more exact estimate of<br>


your closing costs.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


Points are finance charges that are calculated by the lender at closing.<br>


Each point equals 1% of the loan amount. For example, 2 points on a<br>


$100,000 loan equals $2,000. Lenders may charge 1, 2 or 3 points in<br>


up-front costs in addition to the down payment. The more points you pay,<br>


the lower your interest rate will be. In some cases, you may be able to<br>


finance the points.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


So How Much of a Mortgage Can You Afford?<br>


&nbsp;<br>


There are two basic formulas commonly used by lenders to determine how<br>


much of a mortgage you can reasonably afford. These formulas are called<br>


qualifying ratios because they estimate the amount of money you should<br>


spend on mortgage payments in relation to your income and other<br>


expenses.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


It is important to remember that the following ratios may vary from<br>


lender to lender and each application is handled on an individual basis,<br>


so the guidelines are just that -- guidelines. There are many<br>


affordability programs, both government and conventional, that have more<br>


lenient requirements for low- and moderate-income families.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


Many of these programs involve financial counseling for low- and<br>


moderate-income people interested in buying a home and in return, offer<br>


more lenient requirements.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


Generally speaking, to qualify for conventional loans, housing expenses<br>


should not exceed 26% to 28% of your gross monthly income. For FHA<br>


loans, the ratio is 29% of gross monthly income. Monthly housing costs<br>


include the mortgage principal, interest, taxes and insurance, often<br>


abbreviated PITI. For example, if your annual income is $30,000, your<br>


gross monthly income is $2,500, times 28% = $700. So you would probably<br>


qualify for a conventional home loan that requires monthly payments of<br>


$700.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


Any expenses that extend 11 months or more into the future are termed<br>


long-term debt, such as a car loan. Total monthly costs, including PITI<br>


and all other long-term debt, should equal no greater than 33% to 36% of<br>


your gross monthly income for conventional loans. Using the same<br>


example, $2,500 x 36% = $900. So the total of your monthly housing<br>


expenses plus any long-term debts each month cannot exceed $900. For FHA<br>


the ratio is 41%.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maximum allowable monthly
housing expense<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 26% - 28% of gross monthly
income - Conventional<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 29% of gross monthly income -
FHA<br>


&nbsp;<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maximum allowable monthly
housing expense and long-term debt<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 33% - 36% of gross monthly
income - Conventional<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 41% of gross monthly income -
FHA<br>


&nbsp;<br>


One way to determine how much to spend for housing is to compare your<br>


monthly income with monthly long-term obligations and expenses. Use the<br>


worksheet, "Evaluating Your Financial Resources," to determine how much<br>


money you can spend on housing. Be sure to only include income you can<br>


definitely count on.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


When budgeting to buy a home, it is important to allow enough money for<br>


additional expenses such as maintenance and insurance costs. If you are<br>


purchasing an existing home, gather information such as utility cost<br>


averages and maintenance costs from previous owners or tenants to help<br>


you better prepare for homeownership.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


Homeowner's insurance or property insurance is another cost you will<br>


have to consider. The lending institution holding the mortgage will<br>


require insurance in an amount sufficient to cover the loan. However, to<br>


protect the full value of your investment, you might want to consider<br>


purchasing insurance that provides the full replacement cost if the home<br>


is destroyed. Some insurance only provides a fixed dollar amount which<br>


may be insufficient to rebuild a badly damaged house.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


&nbsp;<br>


What Kind Of Property Can You Buy With A Low Down Payment Loan?<br>


&nbsp;<br>


There are few restrictions regarding the type of home you may buy with a<br>


low down payment loan. In addition, low down payment loans may be used<br>


with the wide variety of mortgages.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


Besides price range, there are many other factors to consider when<br>


purchasing a home. It's in your best interest to take care in selecting<br>


a home that will have lasting value as well as provide shelter. Be sure<br>


the neighborhood and house meet the needs of your family. If you have<br>


children, you may want to know if there are other children in the<br>


neighborhood and what schools or playgrounds are nearby. Also consider<br>


the availability of public transportation and how far family members<br>


will have to commute to work or school.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


Check on the condition of the plumbing, heating and electrical systems<br>


and whether they are up to code regulations. The best and easiest way to<br>


do this is through a certified home inspection, from a certified<br>


inspector.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


If you are like most people, a home is the single largest purchase you<br>


will ever make. It is important that you select a home that will meet<br>


your family's needs and keep you happy for years to come. And most<br>


important, you must be able to afford to remain in that home for as long<br>


as you please.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


Your Initial Meeting With a Lender<br>


&nbsp;<br>


The loan approval process generally begins with an initial interview<br>


where the prospective home buyer and the lender meet to discuss the<br>


potential loan. You will need to bring information to verify your income<br>


and long-term debts.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


Often people prefer to meet with the lender before house hunting to<br>


determine in advance what price range they can realistically afford and<br>


the mortgage amount for which they can qualify. This step is called<br>


pre-qualification and can save you much time and trouble by making<br>


certain you are looking in the correct price range.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


For your first meeting with the lender, you should bring:<br>


&nbsp;<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - A purchase contract for the
house (if you have one)<br>


&nbsp;<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Your bank account numbers
and the address of your bank branch,<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along with
checking and savings account statements for the<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; previous
2-3 months<br>


&nbsp;<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Pay stubs, W2 withholding
forms, tax returns for two years, or<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; other
proof of employment and income verification<br>


&nbsp;<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Divorce settlement papers,
if applicable<br>


&nbsp;<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Credit card bills for the
past few billing periods, or canceled<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; checks for
rent or utility bill payments, to show payment history<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and amount
of revolving debt<br>


&nbsp;<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Information on other
consumer debt such as car loans, furniture<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loans,
student loans and retail/credit cards<br>


&nbsp;<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Balance sheets and tax
returns, if you are self- employed<br>


&nbsp;<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Any gift letters, if you are
using a gift from a parent or<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; relative
or other organization to help pay the down payment<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and/or
closing costs. This letter simply states that the money is<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in fact a
gift and will not have to be repaid.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


Having these items on hand when you visit the lender will help speed up<br>


the application process. Usually an application fee and the appraisal<br>


fee will have to be paid when you submit the mortgage application. This<br>


is only done after you have successfully negotiated on a home and have<br>


had your offer accepted by the seller. Generally, there is no fee for<br>


pre- qualification.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


After the initial meeting with the lender, you should have a general<br>


idea if you qualify for the size and type of loan you want. The lender<br>


should let you know if you qualify for the loan in 30 to 60 days. If you<br>


are denied a home loan, the lender must explain the reasons. If this<br>


happens, the lender will usually discuss any options with you.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


Two Key Factors in Qualifying for a Home Loan<br>


&nbsp;<br>


In attempting to approve home buyers for the type and amount of mortgage<br>


they want, lenders basically look at two key factors: the borrower's<br>


ability and willingness to repay the loan. Ability to repay the mortgage<br>


is verified by your current employment and total income. Generally<br>


speaking, lenders prefer for you to have been employed at the same place<br>


for at least two years, or at least be in the same line of work for a<br>


few years.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


The borrower's willingness to repay is determined by examining how the<br>


property will be used. For instance, will you be living there or just<br>


renting it out? Willingness is also closely related to how you have<br>


fulfilled previous financial commitments, thus the emphasis on the<br>


credit report or rent and utility bills.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


It is important to remember that there are no rules carved in stone.<br>


Each applicant is handled on a case-by-case basis. So even if you come<br>


up a little short in one area, perhaps one of your stronger points will<br>


make up for the weak one. Everyone involved in real estate is in the<br>


business of selling homes, in one way or another. Therefore, if the loan<br>


makes sense, lenders and insurers will do their best to see that you<br>


qualify.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


By its very nature, mortgage insurance is an aid to affordability,<br>


because it allows families to purchase homes with less cash on hand. The<br>


industry plays a central role in helping low- and moderate-income<br>


families become homeowners.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


More and more borrowers are taking advantage of low down payment<br>


mortgages and becoming homeowners with as little as 5 percent down. For<br>


more information on how you can take advantage of the benefits of a low<br>


down payment home loan with mortgage insurance, contact your local<br>


lender or real estate agent. For general information on purchasing a<br>


home, contact the county extension office of the U.S. Department of<br>


Agriculture, listed in the government pages of your telephone book.<br>

This table helps you calculate your monthly housing costs, not including<br>


taxes and insurance. For example, assume you have a 30- year mortgage<br>


and the interest rate is 8 percent. The chart shows that the monthly<br>


payment amount per $1,000 is $7.34. If you want to borrow $75,000, you<br>


can estimate the payment by multiplying 75 x $7.34, which equals $550.50<br>


per month.<br>


&nbsp;<br>


As you can see, the lower the interest rate, the easier it is to afford<br>


a home.<br>
