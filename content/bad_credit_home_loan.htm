            <div style="text-align: left;">Bad Credit Home Loan - Mortgage brokers are the source for bad credit home loans loans. They work with nationwide lenders that have home loan programs specifically for people with bad credit.<br /><br />Bad credit is typically classified as several late payments or high debt. Credit scores for bad credit can range between 560 and 620.<p>What if my only option is a bad credit home loan? Unfortunately, building credit is a catch-22 situation. First-time borrowers experience problems getting credit, while those who already have credit find that they do not want or need it. However, young consumers and first-timers still need a credit history as a qualification for bigger loans. The likely scenario then is to build credit slowly. A credit history will help lenders determine if the borrower is a bad risk or is a dependable payer.<p>If you are declined for a mortgage you may want to hire the services of a credit repair company to help increase your credit score and improve your chances of getting a mortgage. These companies charge a wide range of fee's ranging from hundreds to thopusands of dollars. Ask your mortgage broker if he/she knows of a reputable credit repair company that can help you improve your situation.<p>Your mortage professional is bound by federal law to protect your personal financial data. Even if you have some embarassing blemishes on your credit record, your discussion of them with your mortgage professional will be confidential. Only people directly involved with your loan will ever have any knowledge of yoour financial history.<p>There are many home loan programs for people with bad credit. Even if your credit score is below 500 there are still options and mortgage programs that may be available for you. A direct branch bank (such as going to your local KeyBank, NCB, et...) is never going to lend to someone with a below 500 score and possibly not even with below a 600 score. Therefore if you have bad credit or below average scores your best bet is to find a reputable mortgage broker to find the best deal available for you. Even if they can not provide you with something beneficial today, a good mortgage broker will work with you to boost your scores and help direct and educate you on what to do to qualify soon.<p>Many times mortgage brokers have access to 100% financing for borrowers with credit scores 560 and above.<p>Many people feel that financial problems they've experience in the past will prevent them from obtaining a mortgage today.  In today's world that is just not true.  Bad credit lending otherwise known as sub-prime lending is bigger and more readily available than ever before.  Mortgage programs that ignore collections, judgements, medical bills, basically any trade line that doesn't affect title can be ignored by many of today's lenders.  Mortgage brokers make these programs available to people who are consistantly turned down by their local bank.  A mortgage broker can turn a decline into an approval more often than not.<p>There are actually programs now that will go down to 520 FICO score and allow you to get 100% financing.  Yes there are stipulations on these programs but check with your mortgage broker to see if you might be able to qualify for one.  In addition you may have a high DTI or debt-to-income ratio around 50 - 55%.  This would throw you into the same category.  Mortgage brokers, unlike banks, have the ability to source out these specialty programs and make them available to you.<p>With the the resources mortgage brokers have for finding the right loan for your home purchase or refinance, credit issues should not stop you from speaking with a broker.  Brokers work directly with you and the lender in order to overcome all sorts of credit issues that have been keeping you from the financing you want.  Do not let a No from a bank stop you from achieving your goal of home ownership.<p>Mortgage brokers have a greater ability to assist client with poor credit obtain high LTV loans as they have the resources to be able to assist.  I have heard of 95% financing down to a 540 and 100% financing down 10 a 575.  There is one lender I have heard can go down to a 520 score, but unfortunately is not licensed in our state.<p>Bad credit home loans may offer those with poor credit history the chance to own their dream home. In the past, only those with stellar credit ratings were able to apply for quality home loans, but this is no longer true. Bad credit home loans are offered to those who have earned a poor credit rating but are still considered responsible enough to undertake a mortgage. If your credit score has suffered from some temporary setbacks, and you are trying to establish a responsible credit history from this point forward, then a bad credit home loan may be your prime opportunity.<p>This is a great way to get financing until you can work on your credit, bring up your score and get more traditional financing with even better rates.  <a href="mailto:dJones1974@yahoo.com">dJones1974@yahoo.com</a>. Contact us now to find out how we can help you.<p>For example, some lenders often offer programs for 100% financing with credit scores at 580 and sometimes lower, with income fully documented<p>A "bad" credit score is nothing more than a risk-based score which determines how likely it is that a person will default on a credit payment. It's important to understand how your score is calculated. <br /><br />The largest factor which is considered in your credit score is your payment history. Being on time or being late with payments makes up 35% of your credit score. <br /><br />The second fatcor which is calculated is the amounts owed compared to your high balances. This factor weighs in at 30% of your score.<br /><br />Third, your actual length of credit history makes up 10% of your score. The longer your credit history is, the better.<br /><br />Types of credit such as installment loans, mortgages, credit cards, personal loans make up 10% of your credit score as well as your ability to obtain new credit. <br /><br />While this information is deemed reliable, it is not guaranteed. <br /><br /><p>Home buyers with bad credit profiles need to be realistic with the type of home loans they can qualify for.  They should not expect to be charged the same interest rates as homeowners with good credit history.  Lenders who make bad credit home loans always charge a higher interest rate to justify the higher risks associated with this type of mortgage loans.  Homeowners with bad credit can always refinance and enjoy a lower interest rate loan once they have a chance to improve their credit profile.<p>Even if your credit is bad, you can still qualify for a home loan.  Contact your mortgage professional to discuss which products are appropriate for you.<p>Even with bad credit you can purchase a home with no money down.  It just depends on how bad the damaged credit is.<p>If you have bad credit there are many things you can do to increase your credit score. Paying down debt, paying off collections, or charge offs. When you speak to you mortgage broker you can ask them what needs to be done to help increase you score. Also contacting a credit repair service can increase your score.<p>What can I do if I have bad credit? - You may still qualify for a loan, despite credit problems you may have had in the past. In most cases you may qualify for a loan with late payment histories on your credit report, but the lender will want explanations.<p>You should utilize the free annual credit report and obtain a copy of your credit report at least once per year to check for errors and accuracy of the items being reported. By reviewing your credit each year you can insure you are in a better position to obtain financing for a home. There are many companies that specialize in credit repair that can help for a minimal fee to increase your credit scores also so that you can not only qualify for a home mortgage loan but for a home mortgage loan with a good rate. There are many options available for people with bad credit trying to obtain a home loan. Please call at 415-617-5448 or email at <a href="mailto:dJones1974@yahoo.com">dJones1974@yahoo.com</a> to find out how much you qualify for based on your current credit.<p>In some cases a good letter of explanation (LOX) will be accepted by the lender. The letter should explain the circumstances that caused the late payments, foreclosure, etc. If you are borderline eligible for a loan then the LOX may be the fastest way to becoming approved.<p>Many "Subprime" or "Non Prime" banks grant mortgage loans to home buyers with bad credit.  These types of "Sub Prime" mortgages usually carry higher interest rates than Conforming home loans, which are often sold to Fannie Mae and Fredie Mac.  Many of the "Nonprime" loans are offered with a 2-year fixed rate followed by adjustable rates for the remaining 28 years. These types of bad credit home loans are designed to help poor credit home buyers purchase homes, rebuild or repair their credit profiles during the 2 years fixed rate period, and refinance into a Conforming mortgage with better interest rates and terms.<p>Mortgage Lenders Bad Credit - There are three major factors that determine what kind of loan borrowers with poor credit can get. The first is the size of the loan they are looking for.<p>Mortgage lenders that handle bad credit loans usually will loan only at a lower LTV and require housing payment history. This history along with credit score will determine the amount they will lend to the borrower.<p>Mortgage lenders who borrow to people with bad credit are called Sub Prime mortgage brokers/lenders. A mortgage for a borrower with bad credit will carry a higher interest rate then a mortgage for a borrower with good credit. Recently Sub Prime rates have increased due to the increase in sub prime mortgage loan default. If you need to secure a mortgage loan for bad credit think of it as a temporary band aid loan until your credit score increases.<p>Another factor in determining what type of mortgage loan you can get with bad credit is your Loan to Value.<p>Be sure to review your own credit report to make sure only accurate information is being reported.  Many times inaccurate information can be removed to improve your financing terms.<p>Documenting income is very important to a lender when you have very bad credit and are applying for a mortgage. If you need an alternative income documentation loan, this will make it harder to qualify for a bad credit mortgage, may possibly lower your loan to value that you qualify for and will most likely increase the interest rate that you will qualify for as well. Therefore, if you can document your income through traditional methods this will increase your chances of obtaining a mortgage loan with bad credit.<p>When working with mortgage lenders, damaged credit experience counts. If your mortgage professional isn't experienced then several things can go wrong. Damaged credit means there are less lenders that will be willing to make a loan. If your mortgage professional isn't seasoned then you might qualify for a loan and be told there's nothing out there for you.</div>
