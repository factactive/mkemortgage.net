            <br>

A hard money loan is a non institutional loan made by a private lender
or private fund that typically lasts anywhere from 2 to 18 months and
carries a higher APR than a traditional loan. Hard money loans carry a
heavier burden and interest rate for the borrower for the simple reason
that they also pose higher risk for the lender. Hard money loans
typically require that the borrower have 25-50% equity or collateral in
another piece of real estate (although some lenders will accept other
assets such as stocks and bonds as<br>

collateral for the loan).<br>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The availability of hard money can vary from state
to state. For example there are more hard money lenders in California
then there are in Wisconsin.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These types of loans also carry a heavier burden
and interest rate for the borrower for the simple reason that they also
pose higher risk for the lender and are often a temporary solution that
opens doors for a more permanent financial solution or exit strategy.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hard Money loans are non institutional loans funded
by private real estate investors, companies and funds - using their own
money - secured by a first, second, or third Trust Deed against the<br>

subject property.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hard Money is a term that is used almost
exclusively in the United States and Canada where these types of loans
are most common. The term "Hard Money" generally infers that the
borrower has actual &ldquo;hard&rdquo; cash invested.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The hard money industry began in the late 1950s
when the credit industry in the US underwent drastic changes.<br>

The hard money industry suffered severe setbacks during the real estate
crashes of the early 1980s and early 1990s due to lenders funding
properties at well over market value. Since that time, lower LTV rates
have been the norm for hard money lenders seeking to protect themselves
against the market's volatility.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Borrowers with a score below 720 usually find
themselves locked out of the best loan rates and terms offered.
Typically, borrowers with a score below 500 are locked out of the
Conventional and sub prime<br>

market altogether.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 3 criteria you must have to qualify for a hard
money loan:<br>

            <br>

1. Sufficient remaining equity in the property. (Typically 30% or more
after the new loan, including points and fees. The amount of required
equity for hard money loans varies by property type,<br>

location and investor.)<br>

            <br>

2. An acceptable property in a marketable area (at the investor's
discretion)<br>

            <br>

3. The ability to repay the loan to the investor (required by law)</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&raquo; You have a rural property, unique
property, nonconforming property, or mixed-use property and have found
it difficult to qualify for a conventional loan, as long as there's
sufficient<br>

equity in the property, and if the investor/hard money lender deems the
property a worthwhile investment, you may qualify for a hard money loan
            </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&raquo; Complex financing structures. The
property is in the name of a "non-natural person"&ndash; such as a
trust, LLC, partnership, corporation, Non-profit organizations
(churches, foundations) or an entity - rather than an individual </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&raquo; Purchase of Note(s)secured by Deed(s)
of Trust (performing &amp; non-performing) </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Equity based loans offer an alternative to strict
and narrow traditional bank (institutional, conventional) financing,
thereby eliminating many of the usual qualifying, credit and income
underwriting guidelines and delays of banks, mortgage companies or
institutional lenders for traditional mortgage loans.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Conventional and sub prime lenders rely on a credit
grade system or &ldquo;FICO&rdquo; score. The FICO system is a
complex matrix measuring over 30 different variables in an
individual&rsquo;s credit profile. The<br>

FICO system converts the profile into a numeric score, which is added
to an individual&rsquo;s credit report. That score is a reflection
of the computer assigned credit risk for that individual. The intent is
to reduce the amount of subjectivity underwriters (credit decision
makers) inject into the risk analysis process.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are many reasons for seeking private
financing. Just to name a few:<br>

            <br>

&raquo; You have bad credit, minimal credit, or NO credit- Credit
Impacted: low credit scores (below 500 FICO), no credit score, poor,
damaged, bad, bruised, impaired or less-than-perfect credit, limited or
non-existent credit, Late Payments, Slow Pays, Consumer Credit
Counseling, Collections, Charge-Offs, Repossessions, Judgments,<br>

Tax Liens, Bankruptcy, Notice of Default, and Foreclosure. (note: tax
liens, current bankruptcy, judgments, clouds on title, etc., may
require resolution prior to or at closing) Sufficient equity and the
ability to repay the loan are generally more important than your
personal credit </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&raquo; Loss of bank loans, for any reason,
including, {Turn-downs, previously Declined} declines and excessive
conditions </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&raquo; You have a Loan(a borrower and / or a
property) that falls outside the guidelines of traditional financial
institutions and sub-prime lenders Such as - Complete workouts to pay
off heirs and<br>

partners of probate estates, Estate and/or Property held in Probate
(Trusts, Family Limited Partnerships, Irrevocable Trusts, corporations,
etc.), Current Notice of Default/Sale, Distressed<br>

Property Purchase, Property in Receivership, Remove an existing NOD,
Tax Liens/Judgments, Other Liens (Homeowners Associations, property
taxes, etc.), Foreclosure Bailout or Receivership, Bankruptcy (Old or
current), Cash-out Refinance, Divorce, Medical Emergency, Unemployed,
etc. <br>

            <br>

            <b>With "private lenders" the hard assets are the key.</b></font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Equity-driven mortgage loans typically require
25-50% equity in the property and/or collateral in another piece of
real estate, although some lenders will accept other assets such as
stocks and bonds as<br>

collateral for the loan.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hard Money/Bad Credit home loans are ideal for
individuals who have had credit problems in the past, but need a loan
for a new home purchase, mortgage refinance for their existing home,
debt consolidation loan or a home equity loan. If you do not qualify
for a bank loan or a subprime loan, you may still qualify for a private
loan -- also known as a hard money loan or bad credit loan. Typically,
you will need between 25%-50% equity in a property or other hard asset
to use as collateral in order to qualify for a hard money loan. Your
real estate collateral allows a private lender to feel less risk about
making a loan with your low fico score (fico score below 500) and/or
bad credit. Without this equity, hard money lenders will not take on
this loan because of the risk that the borrower will default on the
loan.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&raquo; You need a short-term loan to build,
rehab, or remodel real estate or make improvements to raw land prior to
selling the property or refinancing into long-term permanent financing
(note-hard<br>

money loans used for these purposes require a future value appraisal
and construction documentation for approval) </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&raquo; Property has characteristics making it
difficult to obtain a bank loan, including but not limited to:<br>

            <br>

Partially or nearly completed construction of building, Property
improvements- Rehab, High Vacancy - loan is needed to increase
occupancy of income property, Seismic (Earthquake)<br>

retrofitting </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&raquo; Quick funding for time sensitive loans </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hard Money/Bad credit home loans are a good fit for
anyone who has income and equity to secure a loan but not the credit
score to convince a bank to give them a loan. For these people, you may
need to go with a private bad credit home loan lender for a 12 to 18
months period. Within the state of California, Bad Credit Lender can
provide hard money loans at 11% APR and 3 points. For bad credit home
loans outside of California, other rates apply. At this point, we would
try to get you into a subprime loan where the home<br>

loan rate is more competitive.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In all cases, the general qualifying process is the
same: the investor/lender uses real estate as collateral. The real
estate is reviewed to determine whether it holds sufficient value for
the<br>

investor/lender to be willing to take the risk of making a loan based
on this collateral. The borrower's financial state and future potential
is reviewed to determine the risk factors present. And finally, an exit
strategy is reviewed to determine whether the loan will be completed
satisfactorily within a given time frame. Depending on the results of
this due diligence process, the investor /lender determines whether -
and at what rates and terms - to fund the loan.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&raquo; Balloon Payment Due Refinance your
initial balloon loan into a more traditional loan structure, on or near
the date the balloon payment becomes due </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&raquo; You are a Foreign National with no
long-term U.S. employment or other assets </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&raquo; Note Hypothecations(Loans secured by
Assignment of Note(s) &amp; Deed(s) of Trust) </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These types of loans are referred to by many
different names, such as, private money, private equity, equity, equity
only, equity-based, equity-driven, or asset based.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&raquo; You need a cash equity loan with less
than perfect credit and have a 1st mortgage with a negative
amortization feature &mdash; with the right amount of equity after
the required adjustment for the potential negative amortization you may
qualify for a 2nd mortgage hard money loan </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&raquo; You want to remain anonymous. A
borrower/investor may not want the transaction on their credit report
or the mortgage in their name. Unlike most conventional financing hard
money lenders do not report to credit agencies and allow title to be
held by an entity or Trust </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&raquo; You want to maintain your privacy.
Sometimes individuals prefer to arrange private financing for reasons
of privacy. For example, some people would prefer to buy a recreational
property with private funds vs. institutional financing. They simply do
not want their financial institution to know about all of their
financial<br>

dealings </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&raquo; Creative transactions such as: interest
only payments, partial deed release, and participations are usually
considered </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many hard money lenders will only lend on the first
mortgage (in the industry this is known as being in the 1st-lien
position). If the borrower should default on the loan, the lender is
the first creditor to be paid when the property is sold. Some hard
money lenders will subordinate to another 1st lien position loan these<br>

loans are known as HELOC loans or second lien position loans. This is a
riskier position for the lender as they are the last creditor to
receive remuneration.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Legal &amp; Regulatory Issues<br>

            <br>

From inception, the hard money field has always been formally
unregulated by state or federal laws, although some restrictions on
interest rates (usury laws) by state governments restrict the rates of
hard money.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&raquo; You have high debt-to-income ratios
(too much debt) to qualify for a bank loan&mdash;provided you have
the necessary equity in your property (or down payment) and the ability
to repay the loan, our hard money lenders can make allowances for
excessive debt </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&raquo; You need a business loan secured by
equity in real estate, but cannot qualify or wait for a conventional
business, commercial, or SBA loan </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Equity lenders base their decisions on the
unencumbered property value, its marketability, the borrower's exit
strategy and his or her ability to repay the loan. They generally do
NOT calculate debt ratios and usually do NOT take into account the
borrower&rsquo;s credit and income. Funding is very fast sometimes

            <br>

Hard money lenders structure loans based on loan to value (LTV). The
LTV for most hard money loans will not exceed 75% of the value of the
property. For the purposes of determine an LTV, the word "value"<br>

is defined as 'today's purchase price'. This amount that a lender could
reasonably expect to realize from the sale of the property in the event
that the loan defaults and the property must be sold in a 1-4 months'
time.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unlike conventional and sub prime lenders, Hard
Money Lenders rely on the equity position in the property to guide
their credit decisions.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&raquo; You have non-verifiable, inconsistent,
or unusual income or are, Self-employed, Un-employed or Laid-off
&mdash; provided you can make the loan payment, hard money lenders
will accept loans made to persons who have unconventional incomes. If
you have no income or means of repaying the loan, you might not qualify
for a hard money loan </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hard money loan is an equity driven loan.</font></p>
